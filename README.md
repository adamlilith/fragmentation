# fragmentation

Calculate forest (or similar) fragmentation connectivity, density, and fragmentation class as per <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271763'>Riitters et al. 2020</a> *Conservation Ecology* 4:3. (also see <a href='https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol4/iss2/art3/errata/january26.2001.html'>errata</a>). Forest density, connectivity, and fragmentation indices can be calculated for binary (forest/non-forest) and continuous rasters.
