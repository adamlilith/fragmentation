Description: Calculate forest (or similar) fragmentation connectivity, density,
    and fragmentation class as per Riitters et al. 2020 Conservation Ecology
	4:3. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271763> (also see errata).
	Forest density, connectivity, and fragmentation indices can be calculated
	for binary (forest/non-forest) and continuous rasters.
